## Tech Stack

- **Flask**
- **SQLite** SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library. In contrast to many other database management systems, 
SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program<br>
It comes with Django with itself, no setup required, hence easy to use, but is not recommended for large scale
production application.
- **Bootstrap** Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end Web framework. It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other
 interface components as well as optional JavaScript extensions. [Get Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) <br>
Used for stylising frontend.
